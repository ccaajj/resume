	<h1>Websites</h1>
	<p>I primarily build sites in Drupal, the open source content management system, creating a custom theme specific to the site. Drupal is great where a <small class="sc">CMS</small> is needed since it’s free, flexible, extensible, and quite secure. </p>
	<p>For sites that don’t need to change much over time or are small in scope, the speed and simplicity of a hand-coded site is hard to beat.</p>
	<p>Here are some recent sites I’ve built. </p>

		<p>A common problem when building a website is balancing the needs of the internal audience with the external audience. The people inside the company are experts in their field, and proud of their products. They want to share that expertise, and brag a little about those products, usually at great length.</p>
		<p>The user’s goal on a website at any given moment is almost to find a clear answer to a specific question—how much does it cost, where can I buy it, does it come in blue, how do I return it? </p>

		<h2>Building Websites</h2>
		<h3>HTML<small>5</small> and CSS<small>3</small></h3>
		<p>My primary skill in website building is an excellent understanding of the fundamentals: HTML, and especially CSS.</p>
		<h3>Web Type and Typography</h3>
		<p>Implementing them has a few pitfalls, whether on the server or using a vendor like fonts.com: grouping faces within a family so &lt;bold&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and &lt;i&gt; all work properly; using &lt;small&gt; to enable true small caps.</p>
		<p>In terms of typography, line measure</p>

<!--===== Reference =====-->
<article id="a-ref" class="main-block">
	<h1>Reference</h1>
	<p>The goals when building a website haven’t changed much over time: present useful information in a way that the user can readily understand. But techniques and technologies invloved change really fast and keeping up with the latest is a challenge for everyone who works online. Here’s how I stay current. </p>
	<section>
		<h2>Newsletters</h2>
		<h3>CSS-Tricks</h3>
		<p>CSS ain’t perfect and when it cannot do something that needs to be done, Chris Coyier and company find ways to make it work. The rest of the web often follows.</p>
		<h3>Nielson Norman Group Newsletter</h3>
		<p>Originally Alertbox by Jakob Nielson, now the best source for insight on data-driven UX design. They do the testing and we learn what works, what doesn’t, and (often) why.</p>
		<h3>CSS Layout News</h3>
		<p>Rachel Andrews of grid layout fame writes about it and other innovations in web layout systems.</p>
		<h3>Seth’s Blog</h3>
		<p>Anti-marketer Seth Godin writes about how (and why) brands should earn loyalty and goodwill: through honesty and empathy instead of the usual tricks and cheats.</p>
		<h3>Conscious Style Guide</h3>
		<p>“For anyone curious or serious about conscious language.” Our understanding, awareness  and respect for difference is (thankfully) evolving rapidly these days. The language we use needs to evolve as well to ensure inclusivity.</p>
		<h3>New Thinking</h3>
		<p>“Digital transformation,” when successful, is organization-centric thinking giving way to customer-centric thinking. Gerry McGovern writes about how organizations will adapt or perish.</p>
		<h3>Hacker News</h3>
		<p> Ostensibly for “anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity” but mostly a good resource for flagging big news in the programming, coding and techbiz worlds.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Podcasts</h2>
		<h3>The Big Web Show</h3>
		<p>Jeffrey Zeldman’s <em>Designing With Web Standards</em> championed semantic markup when all was chaos—which helped make the web a medium that works on any browser on any device—and helped turn web development into a profession rather than an arcane set of nerdy tricks.</p>
		<h3>The Web Ahead</h3>
		<p>Jen Simmons, an evangelist for sophisticated layouts using grid and flexbox, talks to people working on the next big things in front-end web technology.</p>
		<h3>Security Now</h3>
		<p>Malicious botnets based on hijacked home wifi routers can flood any web server with enough traffic to cause a denial-of-service to legitimate traffic. Steve Gibson, who coined the term “spyware” in 1995, keeps an eye on developments like this and helps listeners understand the security environment of the modern internet.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Books</h2>
		<h3>Envisioning Information</h3>
		<p>Edward Tufte is one of a kind. I’m not sure whether I read this or <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em> first, but these were my first exposure to the idea that information can be presented well—or poorly—and there were established conventions for doing it right. </p>
		<h3>Don’t Make Me Think!</h3>
		<p>Steve Krug’s title just about says it all. Users are impatient and overloaded, with their cursors always hovering over the Back button. Good websites are intuitive and meet the user more than halfway. If not, they leave—quickly! </p>
		<h3>Designing With Web Standards</h3>
		<p>Building websites in the 90s was often a combination of hacking and guerilla art, and most <small class="sc">html</small> was copied from existing sites (<small class="sc">css</small> had not yet become popular). Zeldman’s DWS made a strong case that, for the medium to mature, it needed to standardize and professionalize, with “semantic markup” as its rallying cry.</p>
		<h3>A Book Apart</h3>
		<p>Short books by experts, designed to get practitioners up to speed.   Vital for understanding and implementing new web technologies and practices as they emerge.</p>
